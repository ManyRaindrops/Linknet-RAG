# Linknet
RAG and AI powered knowledge organization and relation creation software. Built using Python, with integration of standard libraries such as langchain (coming soon).

## Project Goals
1. Become familiar with RAG systems and LLM API's
2. Create a program to maximize user-document-LLM efficiency.

Stages:
1. Learn the material: with the resources listed below, learn and implement RAG features using basic python.
2. With the previously acquired knowledge, use LangChain to build a RAG application

## Current Goals
1. Prepare the first basic-python only version.
2. Implement lang-chain into 

## Resources Used
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-handbook/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVcwVQRHIc8&t=1700s
- Leading LLMs (free plan): GPT 4o, Gemini, and DeepSeek
- Copilot feature

## LLM Usage
1. Explaning new/hard concepts: very useful for quickly getting a response rather than having to search through general coding websites.
2. Writing helpful comments: especially useful for the learning process, when not all points are in memory or fully understood. Comments by AI are labeled: "AI-made"
3. Generating Python scipts: used for automating and templating of journal and note entries; the focus of this project is on webdevelopment
4. Writing temporary example code: helpful in the learning process to see relevant examples. Such AI generated code was removed or indicated as such
